### ISSUE

* The installer checks the date on the computer.
* If the date isnâ€™t current, you get the error above.
* The fix involves correcting the date on your Mac.

### How to Fix

* If you use an external boot disk, your Mac starts up into OS X Disk Utilities.
* You can access the Terminal by clicking on the Utilities menu and selecting Terminal.
* Once the Terminal has launched, follow these steps.
