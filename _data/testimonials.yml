    review: "Mitesh worked mainly on EasyEngine @rtCamp. He single-handedly coded entire EasyEngine in early days. Later on, he builded a nice team to handle growth of the project. From hiring, training to mentoring - he managed his team very well. At the same time, he worked hard on customer support forum and actively contributed to many other open-source projects during his tenure at rtCamp. Apart from EasyEngine, Mitesh's knowledge on linux and security helped rtCamp in many areas. rtCamp is honored to have Mitesh working with us."

    review: "Mitesh is a very proactive person and is very professional and friendly to work with. His skills in Ubuntu, System administration and Nginx is exceptional. He spearheaded one of the prime products at rtCamp called EasyEngine. He actively developed & maintained the product based on developer and community feedback. Mitesh is very helpful and resourceful and essentially a good team player. He helped me at various instances while EasyEngine was in it's baby steps. He also helped with production environment setups. He is creative and simplistic in his approach to solve problems and focuses on automation. I highly recommend Mitesh for his groundwork experience and exceptional skills."

    review: "Mitesh is good at Shell Scripting and Linux System administration. He is capable of handling the whole team, There were around 10-15 developers, and he was able to help each one of them whenever required. He developed the EasyEngine-CLI tool to manage WordPress and other PHP hosting and handled all the support and other tasks related to it. He is really good at Server administration. I wish him best for his future endeavours. :)"

    review: "Mitesh has been a lifesaver. I was having some server issues due to poor configurations of previous admins. Mitesh stepped in and resolved things without hesitations. I now have great speed and reliability. He's very responsive and I feel safe in his hands even though I really can't comprehend most of the work he does. He explains it if I ask, but I have now just learned to trust him as an expert. I would definitely recommend Mitesh for your server needs."
