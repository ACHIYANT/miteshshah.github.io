### What is LEMP Stack
* LEMP is a variation of the ubiquitous LAMP stack used for developing and deploying web applications.
* Traditionally, LAMP consists of Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, and PHP.
* Due to its modular nature, the components can easily be swapped out. With LEMP, Apache is replaced with the lightweight yet powerful NGINX.
